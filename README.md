# Traffic Light Component in React

This project demonstrates a simple traffic light simulation using React. The traffic light component, `TrafficLight`, cycles through red, green, and yellow lights with specific durations for each color. This simulation continuously loops through these colors indefinitely.

## Component Details

- **Red Light:** Active for 4000 milliseconds.
- **Green Light:** Active for 3000 milliseconds.
- **Yellow Light:** Active for 500 milliseconds.

The traffic light starts with the red light active, followed by green, then yellow, and this sequence repeats.

## Requirements

1. **React:** The component is built using the React library.
2. **Styling:** The traffic light is styled to be visually appealing, with clear indications of which light is active.
